# Spring Cloud Data Flow Demo
This is a simple set of examples to explore Spring Cloud Data Flow.

These will build over time.

## Server and DSL Example

With Spring XD it was easy to create flows that resulting in data moving from a source to a sink by taking advantage of:

- Spring Data
- Spring Integration
- Spring Batch

The Spring XD DSL made it possible to leaverage the power of these projects without needing to work with these projects directly. This opens the door for now Java developers to create flows.

The following is an demo of the Simple Tick Tock flow used to demo Spring XD, but using Spring Cloud Data Flows.
